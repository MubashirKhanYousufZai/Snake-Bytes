## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **general-purpose programming language** created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.

It was designed with one core philosophy:

> Code should be **easy to read**, **easy to write**, and **easy to maintain**.

Unlike many older programming languages, Python focuses on:
- Human-readable syntax
- Minimal boilerplate code
- Logical structure over symbols

Because of this, Python has become a favorite among beginners and professionals alike.

## Key Characteristics of Python

Python stands out because of the following characteristics:

### 🔹 High-Level Language
You do not need to manage memory or hardware-level details. Python handles these internally, allowing you to focus on logic.

### 🔹 Interpreted Language
Python code is executed line by line. This makes debugging easier and speeds up development.

### 🔹 Dynamically Typed
You do not need to declare variable types explicitly.

Example:
```python
age = 20
name = "Mubashir"
